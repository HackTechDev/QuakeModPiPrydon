Released December 2nd, 2003


ATTENTION
---------

This demo should be considered BETA quality and not representative of the
final game. This demo is being released as an appeal to the Quake and gaming
community for help. If you'd like to help develop this game, please contact
the authors at frikac@inside3d.com.

This version REQUIRES Quake to run. The full game most likely will not. The
reason is we don't yet have enough original sounds and content.


About
-----

The Curse of Korweh is an add on side mission to the story of Prydon Gate.
It takes place in a mysterious and ancient desert in the eastern part of
Prydon. This version of Korweh comes bundled with an updated version of the
Prydon Gate demo, enabling you to play the new maps alongside the original
demo. This is not the full release of the game. That will come later,
maybe.


The Curse of Korweh
-------------------
A thousand years ago people believed in the gods of the ancient and extinct
Namus. They believed that Kor created the world in a great cataclysm of
flame and earth. Feeling the need to tie their beliefs to the land of their
heritage, they adopted the idea that the great eastern desert of Prydon
was a sacred ground of Kor, a meeting place for him to meet with his
children. A great temple was built in the heart of the desert to honor Kor
and believers treked into the many miles to pay tribute to the all powerful
god of fire. The desert and temple itself both became known as "Korweh" or
"Kor's home on earth".

It was all too easy to become lost or killed in the vast deserts of Korweh.
Carrying food and gold to offer to Kor, these unarmed and unprepared pilgrims
soon became easy targets for a vicious group of bandits. They called themselves
the Takers, deriving from "Ta Kor" or "those against Kor". Though their name
suggested they had some sort of religious origin, they were nothing more than
common thieves. The thieves, preying up on the most faithful, including the
priesthood of the Kor sect had all but wiped them out. Then a great cataclysm
befell the land of Prydon. As Ithael travels back from lands far to the north
he hears a tale of an object that may prove useful-

The Eye of Kor, a mysterious trinket forged in the laval caves of the Korweh
desert and held as a remanant of the god Kor himself, is rumored to dispell
any magic. Travel into the desert and find the long lost Eye of Kor. IT IS
YOUR DESTINY or something.

Help and Troubleshooting
------------------------

If you need help please post on http://forums.inside3d.com or send a mail to
frikac@inside3d.com. Be sure to put "Prydon Gate" in the topic. I will not
respond 'good job' or 'you suck' mails, As these do not demand a reply.
Replies may be delayed or may not come at all, depending on the content of
the message. If you want fast help, use the above stated forum.

Bug reports are appreciated, if possible make a save game at the point the
bug occurred in game, and provide a method for reproducing the bug. Credit
will be given.


Future
------

If you'd like to help with Prydon Gate and are a competent mapper (meaning you
can make maps better than seen in this demo). I urge you to help.

If you can model for Quake, we need your help. The majority of models in this
game are either substandard or we're not satisfied with the license under
which we obtained them (*cough*). If you can improve upon or merely substitute
just about any model in the game, we'd appreciate it.

If you have an 'interesting voice' and would like to play a role of one of the
characters in the mod, great! Send us a sample of your voice via e-mail and
we can probably find a character for you. But if we don't find enough people
willing to do voices, don't be surprised if we don't get back to you.

If you can create sound effects or know of some royalty free sounds which we
can use, we need your help! Many sounds of this mod need to be replaced to
become a stand alone game.


Copyright and Distribution
--------------------------

All original material shouldn't be stolen and reused, but it will be so 
I don't care anyway. You can mirror this file, modify this file or use this
file as a head rest, but you may not claim this file or portions of it as your
own, that just irks me. If you're thinking about doing something with this file
outside of what you're supposed to do, stop thinking about it and go get a
drink and maybe watch some TV. Your whole life shouldn't be doing illegal
things with this file. Get out, live a little, it will do you some good. In
fact, stop reading this readme, it's a big waste of your time. Everything
we own belongs to us and usually nobody else. That's what ownership is really
all about. As such, we own it and we're just letting you use and distribute it.
That's the basics right there. It's like if I handed you a watch, and said you
could use it for the day. This doesn't suddenly become your watch, you can't go
brag to your friend "hey look at my new watch!", that'd be wrong. So just don't
do that with this file. Sure, if you want to make a mod and use some files we 
made that are in this file we'll let you, but don't just redress the mod and
rerelease it, that's like putting some red paint on the watch and claiming
it's an entirely different watch. The persons portrayed in this demo don't
actually exist and we have no proof they ever existed so any resemblance to
persons living or undead is purely coincidental. Locations in this demo
actually do exist, but they're not as cute as we make them seem. They are
horrid horrid places as most of them are in Britain. Not that I have anything
against Britain, but they're just... you know. Some of my best friends are from
Britain in fact so don't start accusing me of hating Britain. Oh, King Morgan
is an actual historical figure so scratch that last thing about never existing.
Chances are he won't sue us though since he died over a 1000 years ago.
